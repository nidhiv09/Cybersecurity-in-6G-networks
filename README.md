üåê Cyber Knowledge Graph (CKG)
A connected graph database for enhanced cybersecurity threat intelligence.

üåü Overview
This repository contains a Cyber Knowledge Graph (CKG) that integrates various cybersecurity datasets (CVE, CWE, CAPEC, ICS Attack, Mobile Attack) into a unified graph database using Neo4j. This graph-based approach enhances threat intelligence by establishing meaningful relationships between vulnerabilities, exploits, and attack patterns, moving beyond siloed data to a holistic, connected view.

‚ú® Features
Unified Knowledge Graph: A single, interconnected graph linking multiple cybersecurity datasets.

Neo4j AuraDB: Utilizes a powerful cloud-native graph database for efficient querying and real-time visualization.

Automated Data Import: Scripts for converting and importing diverse datasets into the graph with ease.

Graph Analytics & Threat Detection: Leverage the power of relationships to uncover complex attack paths and detect threats more effectively.

Querying & Visualization: Seamless integration with Neo4j Browser and APIs for powerful data exploration.
